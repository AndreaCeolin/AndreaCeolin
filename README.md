# Andrea's GitHub

Welcome to my Github page! :wave:

Here is a user-friendly summary of my current research projects. For a list of my published works, check my [website](https://andreaceolin.eu).

### 1. [Language Identification for low-resource languages](https://andreaceolin.github.io/DialectID_TLDR.html) :mountain:
CNNs are the state-of-the-art techniques for classifying images. Can we adapt them to classify similar languages when we have little training data?

### 2. [Predicting sentiment and editorial behavior on Wikipedia Editor's pages](https://aclanthology.org/2021.naacl-main.177/) :handshake:
 Linguistic features can be used to predict sentiment change and persuasion. Can we use them to achieve BOTH tasks simultaneously?

### 3. [ChigiBot](https://andreaceolin.github.io/chigibot.html) :business_suit_levitating:
App to guess who is the Italian Prime Minister most likely to have made a specific statement!
