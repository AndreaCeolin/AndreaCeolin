# Andrea's GitHub

Welcome to my Github page! :wave:

Here is a user-friendly summary of my current research projects. For a list of my published works, check my [website](https://andreaceolin.eu).

### 1. [Functional Load and sound change](https://andreaceolin.eu/functional_load_TLDR.html) :speaking_head:
New accents are created as a consequence of sound changes. Can we predict which sounds might change in a language given their distribution in the lexicon?

### 2. [Language Identification for low-resource languages](https://andreaceolin.eu/DialectID_TLDR.html) :mountain:
CNNs are the state-of-the-art techniques for classifying images. Can we adapt them to classify similar languages when we have little training data?

### 3. [The Parametric Comparison Method](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.488871/full) :earth_africa:
Classifying languages on the basis on common sounds/words is challenging, because sounds and words change very rapidly. Can we use morphosyntactic features to achieve the task?

### 4. [Predicting sentiment and editorial behavior on Wikipedia Editor's pages](https://aclanthology.org/2021.naacl-main.177/) :handshake:
 Linguistic features can be used to predict sentiment change and persuasion. Can we use them to achieve BOTH tasks simultaneously?
