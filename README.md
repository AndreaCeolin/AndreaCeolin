# Andrea's GitHub

Welcome to my Github page! Here is a brief summary of my current research projects:

***

## Linguistics

### 1. [Functional Load and sound change](http://andreaceolin.eu/PWPL2020.pdf)
New accents are created as a result of sound change. Can we predict which sound might change in a given language just on the basis of the distribution of the sounds in the lexicon?

### 2. [The Parametric Comparison Method](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.488871/full)
Classifying languages on the basis on common sounds/words is extremely challenging, because sounds and words change very rapidly. Can we use morphosyntactic features instead?

## Natural Language Processing

### 1. [Language Identification for low-resource languages](https://aclanthology.org/2021.vardial-1.12/)
CNNs are the state-of-the-art techniques for classifying images. Can we adapt them to classify similar languages, even when the training data is limited?

### 2. [Predicting sentiment and editorial behavior on Wikipedia Editor's pages](http://andreaceolin.eu/WikiTalkEdit_naacl.pdf)
Linguistic features can be used to predict sentiment change, but also to predict persuasion. Can they be used to achieve BOTH tasks simultaneously?
