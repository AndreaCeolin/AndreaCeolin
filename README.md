Welcome to my Github page! Here is a brief summary of my current research projects:

## 1. The Parametric Comparison Method

What if we could compare the languages in the world by means of a universal set of morphosyntactic features which are in principle available to every language learner in the stage of language acquisition? 

The Parametric Comparison Method (Guardiano and Longobardi 2005, Longobardi and Guardiano 2009) is inspired by Chomsky's 'Principles and Parameters' model, according to which the possible variation in grammatical structures in human languages is limited to a finite set of possible choices.

Although the model has been judged as inadequate by more recent theoretical research, it proved to be useful for the purposes of language classification and language generation.

Here is a nice heatmap that shows how much variation we found in a sample of about 70 languages spoken in Eurasia, for which 94 morphosyntactic parameters have been collected:
